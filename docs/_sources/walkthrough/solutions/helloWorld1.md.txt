# Challenge 1
In this question, you were asked to write a program that says "Hello Asylum User!" in one line of code. Of course, all this requires is a call to the `println` function like this: `println("Hello Asylum User!");`. You can do this with a top-level statement, but remember, you can also use `=>` for functions that are only 1 expression:

```rust
println("Hello Asylum User!");
```
Output:
```
Hello Asylum User!
```

```rust
fn main() => println("Hello Asylum User!");
```
Output:
```
Hello Asylum User!
```
