# Challenge 5
Finally, you were asked to calculate `4 * (2 + 1) % 3`.

First, we take care of the values in parenthesis. This leaves us with `4 * 3 % 3`. Multiplication and modulo have the same precedence, so we go from left to right. `4 * 3` is `12`, and `12 % 3` is `0`, so `0` is our final answer.
