# About Asylum
Asylum is a mid-level programming language that is designed to be used from everything from embedded systems' kernels to general application development. Mid-level means that the language is not particularly close or abstract from the underlying computer's hardware. Here is a list of a few languages, sorted from lower level to higher level:
* Assembly
* C/C++
* Asylum
* Rust
* C#/Java
* Python

As you can see, Asylum is close to Rust when it comes to dealing with more low-level aspects of development. Do not fear a low level language for the sake of it being potentially harder: while this can be the case, Asylum wishes to change this by introducing features of the higher-level languages without removing the ability to do low lovel operations as well.

## Inspiration
Asylum takes inspiration from various languages. As you may have noticed, the syntax for the most part is a combination of Rust and C#, and has some of their features as well. C#, Rust, C, and Python were the main contributing factors to how this language was designed. From C, the low-level pointer math, and from Python, the ability for a program to look like a simplistic script.
