# Challenge 1
Here, you were asked to explain the difference between a signed and unsigned integer. The difference is that an unsigned integer can NOT be negative, while a signed integer can be. That's what the "signing" does, it allows a value to be negative. The most common signed type is `int`, but of course this is subjective and can be other answers like `short`, `s24`, etc. as long as the type is signed.
