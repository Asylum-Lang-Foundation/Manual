# Challenge 1
For this challenge, you were to make a program that prints the sum of two variables to produce "Hello World!". Like numbers, in Asylum, you can add strings together as well (the below is just one of many possibilities):

```rust
fn main() {
    string hello;
    hello = "Hello ";
    string world = "World!";
    println(hello + world);
}
```
Output:
```
Hello World!
```
