# Challenge 2
In this questions, you were asked to explain the difference between floating-point and fixed-point numbers. Floating-point numbers do NOT have a set number of bits that represent the whole portion and the decimal portion (hence the decimal point "floats"), where as fixed-point numbers do, which makes it possible to operate on them like normal integers scaled by a factor. A common floating-point type is `float`, but of course this is subjective, and other answers such as `double` and `f80` are also valid.
